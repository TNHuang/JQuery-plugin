      <p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi equals big personality in a little dog. These are intelligent, active, alert little guys who will want to be the center of your world. They love to be with their families, and will shower you with loyalty, devotion and affection. They need daily exercise and love to take long walks with you. They are intelligent and eager to please and do great with obedience training. They excel in obedience, agility, flyball, Frisbee, herding, and tracking competitions.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane" id="shiba">
      <p>The Shiba Inu is a unique breed. Intelligent, active, energetic, they think pretty highly of themselves. They are famous for their spirited boldness and independent nature. If you are not careful, they will train you. Early obedience training is important, but even then, Shibas don't really enjoy being obedient. Off leash work is especially challenging and the recall might require a miracle. They love to run and they love to run away. They are escape artists and owners must be careful every single time they open a door because they will bolt. Some can even climb chain link fences. </p>

    <div class="tab-pane" id="yorkie">
      <p>The Yorkshire Terrier is feisty, alert, inquisitive, energetic, determined, brave, bossy, scrappy and boisterous. But he can also be very sweet. He can be described as a little dog with a big personality! He's one of the most popular breeds in the Unite States. He craves close physical contact and affection and will follow you around the home like a shadow. His prey-drive is high and he will chase any little creature that scurries by him. He gets along well with strangers but he can be aggressive with other dogs. He's very affectionate and loves to cuddle and sit on your lap.</p>
